<!--
  
Base class for some of the elements in the Basic Web Components collection.

This provides some services which aren't provided by the browser or Polymer.
Right now, this includes:

* Generic styling. A "generic" attribute, which defaults to true, allows
  elements to receive baseline styling that can easily be removed by setting
  "generic" to false.

* contentChanged. A callback invoked when an element's light DOM content changes.
  This is also invoked if the element contains a <content> node and new nodes
  are distributed to that. Note: if an element has an attached callback, the
  callback should invoke this.super() for contentChanged to work.

* Content flattening. General-purpose composable elements need to be able to
  walk their content tree, including distributed content. This class defines
  helpers called flattenChildren, flattenChildNodes, flattenTextContent that
  parallel the standard children, childNodes, and textContent properties,
  respectively, expanding any content nodes to include distributed content.
